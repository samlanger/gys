<h1> Welcome to Get You Started </h1>
<p>
  There are so many aspects to building a company in any domain. To name a few:</p>
  <ul>

<li>Getting a team</li>
<li>Getting on google</li>
<li>Getting a logo</li>
<li>Getting a website</li>
<li>Selling, Marketing, Negotiating, Motivating</li>
<li>Legal questions</li>
<li>Investor questions</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems so overwhelming...And it is! Starting a company is not easy. But you don't need to go out and read a book on every one of these topics. We know because some of us did!  It's hard. But its not as time consuming as some of us make it out to be. We help people get on their feet. We do it quickly, efficiently and cost effectively. And we do it in a number of ways. </p>

                <h4 class='question'>How much does this all cost?</h4>
                <p class='answer'> That depends! Depending on what you want and which partner you're working with, the price can range from 0- infinite.
Maybe its some free advice, maybe it's paying for someones time, maybe its paying for something tangible(like a website or logo), or maybe if you get the partner interested enough you can come up with an equity arrangement!

We'll always keep your financial needs in mind when connecting you with a partner</p>
